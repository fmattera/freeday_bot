# freeday_bot

This is the GitHub repository related to the Freeday case. This is Francesco's work. 

First of all, I granted access to the Dialogflow CX agent to k.ramsodit@freeday.ai. 
LEGENDA:
static_api.py // this file is the static version of the weather api call, given a date and a location. The script calls the external link, scrapes teh data it needs and outputs it to the terminal.
